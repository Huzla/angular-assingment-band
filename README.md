# AngularAssingmentBand

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.0.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). Note that Karma has been set up to use Chrome or Vivaldi. You should have a binary for one of these browsers installed.

## Where to find solutions for tasks?

My solutions for the two tasks are under `src/app/task1` and `srx/app/task2`. The main application shows examples of using the service implemented in task1 and the dialog implemented in task2.

## Some thoughts on the solutions

I focused on compliting the functionality described in the assignment. Therefore, only the dialog component and the band enrinchment service are tested. Additionally, to increase the flexibility of the dialog, I designed it to be usable without any particular library. Therefore, eventhough the surrounding code uses RXJS
the dialog does not.
